Project: Flipkart TV Web Scraping and EDA

Overview:
This project aims to extract data on different TVs from Flipkart's website using web scraping techniques and then conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the scraped data. The project is divided into these main components:

Web Scrapping: This is the main part of the project where we scrap the data from the site of Flipkart to get the data.
Data: Here we focus on scraped data from Flipkart's website and storing it in a CSV file.
Data Cleaning: Here, extensive data cleaning and preparation procedures are implemented to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
EDA:  Here, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights and visualize patterns in the scraped TV data.
